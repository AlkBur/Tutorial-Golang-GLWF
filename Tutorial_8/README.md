# Tutorial 8 : Basic shading

In this 8th tutorial, we will learn how to do some basic shading. This includes :

    Beeing more bright when closer to a light source
    Having highlights when looking in the reflection of a light (specular lighting)
    Beeing darker when light is not directly towards the model (diffuse lighting)
    Cheating a lot (ambient lighting)
